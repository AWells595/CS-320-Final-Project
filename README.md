# CS-320-Final-Project

## How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
I can ensure that my work is functional and secure by using robust testing praticies. This includes white-box and/or black box testing with unit testting. This 
also includes the need for other testing such as integration testing and systems testing.

##  How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
I inteperet user needs literally and ask clarifiying questions to make sure I understand the problem space I need to work in. 

## How do I approach desiginging software?
I apporach desiging software in a hollistic way. I start by gathering user requirements and planning out the strucutre of the code needed to mee those requirements.
I then ask clarifying questions to make sure that me and the user are on the same page with what is needed, then i go about putting the outline into actual code.
